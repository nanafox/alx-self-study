# Module 1.9 - Karibu Lessons on Africa in 2035

*Moonshot* means **goals so big that they may seem impossible, like going to the moon**

## Nuggets from the Moonshot Speech in 1960

Take on challenges not because they are easy (if it was, everyone would have done it), but because they are hard. This thinking proves the **adventurous** nature of the people who were willing to go to the moon, even though it has never been done and there weren't any existing blueprint they could carve out from.

*Accept* that it will be hard, but don't give in to the notion that it's impossible. The **resilience** required to do hard things is quite *as big as the moon* itself. Even in the face of doubts, keep working. **This is not a dream you should be willing to postpone, but one that you intend to win**.

Your radical ideas serves as a way to push you to use all of your grit, as well as your **humility** to be patient even as you work steadily towards the goal.

Project into the future even when the resources doesn't seem readily available. List all the *moving parts* that will help achieve the **goal**.

Doing this helps you stay on track. This way, you will know what you have and what you need to get. And as you get these things which you lack, you update your inventory and keep moving. Keeping this list will help you form the big picture of everything needed for a successful execution of *the goal*.

Also, lay out the plan and individual steps that should / would be taken to reach the goal. A clear pathway gives you time to think about the solution, rather than worry about all the *moving parts*. You tackle each step as you go.

It is important to acknowledge the fact that it will be hard, but most importantly, the fact that you are willing to **do hard things!**

## Qualities of the Moonshot Idea

- It is **BOLD**
- It is radical and disruptive
- It is **hard**
- There is no *definitive road map*, but it is qualified by use of data and failure.
- It is timely
