# Module 1.7 - Karibu Lesson on Core Values

## List of Personal Values

These are values you discovered as part of a success or something you are usually identified with.

Your personal values help you to stay motivated even when the going gets tough. Your ability to be resilient and curious about how and why things work they way they do gets you to dig deeper and spend more time figuring out solutions to complex problems.

Thinking critically about your next steps and their impacts based on facts allows to be sure of the outcome of your actions. Sure, there will be times where you just have to trust your grit and get something done. Sometimes, it doesn't even have to make sense in the beginning.

All these are possible when you are in sync with your Self.
