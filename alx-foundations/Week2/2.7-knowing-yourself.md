## The Need for Self-Awareness

*“The best leaders know themselves best and surround themselves with the rest.”*
*- Lori Stohs*

Self-awareness is defined as conscious knowledge of oneself; it’s a stepping stone to reinventing oneself, learning to make wiser decisions, and helps you tune into your thoughts and feelings. *Source: [Paul Jun's Article](http://99u.com/articles/30437/its-all-our-fault-self-awareness-as-a-secret-weapon-for-habit-change)*

A self-aware person knows what drives them and how to expand on them. They also know what triggers them and how to bring it under subjection. *(Self direction)*

Self-awareness is a life-long journey.

   - your area of specialization
   - experiences
3. **What can I do?**
   - things you can do easily

*“For a person who is not aware that he is doing anything wrong has*
*no desire to be put right. You have to catch yourself doing*
*it before you can reform.” - Seneca(Roman philosopher)*
