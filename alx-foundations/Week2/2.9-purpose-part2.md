## Global Challenge: Climate Change

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns. These shifts can be natural, such as changes in the sun's activity or large volcanic eruptions.

Climate change can be caused [human activities](https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/) as well, such as burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.

> Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example.[<sup>[1]<sup>](<https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change> "UN: What is Climate Change")

The broad categories of needed action to mitigate climate change are:

- cutting emissions
- adapting to climate impacts
- financing required adjustments

## Global Opportunity: Agriculture

> Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach to managing landscapes—cropland, livestock, forests and fisheries—that address the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change.[<sup>[2]</sup>](<https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climate-smart-agriculture> "Climate Smart Agriculture")
>
> - It has explicit focus on addressing climate change.
> - CSA systematically considers the synergies and tradeoffs that exist between productivity, adaptation and mitigation.
> - CSA aims to capture new funding opportunities to close the deficit in investment.

### Aims of CSA

To achieve three outcomes:

- Increased productivity
  - produce better food especially for the 75% of the world's poor population
  - the food must be nutritious
- Enhanced resilience
  - reduce the vulnerability to
    - climate-related risks and shocks
    - pests and droughts
  - improve capacity to grow in the face of adversities
- Reduced emissions
  - practice afforestation
  - identify ways to absorb carbon from the atmosphere

### Global Opportunity: Tech x Agriculture

Technology is at the forefront of implementing CSA. These include satellite imagery, big data and impact models (that are used as crop and soil simulators run in the cloud).<sup>[3]</sup>

- Satellite imagery enable us to
  - map crop production areas,
  - track plant growth stages,
  - identify the use (or the lack thereof) of climate-smart production practices and
  - even predict yields.

- Impact models is used for running crop and soil simulators in the cloud
  - produces estimates of the environmental impacts of past and current agricultural practices,
  - models the impact of future practices
  - uses the satellite imagery and big data as its information sources

<strong>Other Global Challenges CSA solves</strong>

- Job creation through income generation for 75% of the world's poor communities.
- Healthcare through improved nutritional security.

> Blue River Technology is an AI-powered platform that uses computer vision to identify and spray weeds in crops without harming the actual crops. This will undoubtedly help the world immensely with food production over the next century.
