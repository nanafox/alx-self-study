# Module 2.3 - The Daily 3: Movement

The most important part of this activity is to consistently do something, even it seems so small.

Move your body in some way, every day. It could be could be dancing, cooking, swimming, taking a walk, etc. Just about anything you do that involves moving your body, do it.

Take breaks and lift yourself from your chair. You only get more productive when your body is active.

## How to go about

1. Be committed. Set a goal and commit to it.
2. Schedule it
   Don't just say it and leave it to chance. Mark it on your calendar
3. Pick any kind of movement / exercise that you enjoy
   Choose an activity and move with it every day, at a constant time. This way it becomes part of your daily routine
4. Do what you said you are going to do
   Now it's planned and scheduled, it's time to stick with your goals. Nothing is small, improve each day.
5. Track what you do each day.
   Ensure that you are keeping track of what you are doing and checking out the boxes as you do them. Use your calendar as you go.
