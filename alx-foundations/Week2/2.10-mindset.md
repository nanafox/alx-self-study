## Grit - Perseverance in the face of challenges

Grit is the **passion** and **tenacity** towards **long-term**, worthwhile goals. It is the **capacity** to stick with something and **show perseverance** in the face of challenges. Being naturally intelligent and skilled is wonderful, but to really succeed and thrive, we need the capacity for perseverance.

### Note on Grit from TED Talk

- Life is a marathon, not a sprint
- Talent doesn't make you gritty
- Grit is not directly to any measure of talent, it's simply your ability to thrive
- Works well with Growth Mindset.
- Willingness to persevere even when you fail
- Failure should be embrace and nurtured for better results on next iteration
