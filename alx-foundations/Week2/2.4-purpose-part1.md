# Module 2.4 - Purpose: Part 1

People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.

**WHAT** you do serves as the proof of what you believe **(Your WHY)**.

Starting with your **WHY** is how you *explain* your **purpose** and the *reason why you exist* and operate the way you do. Strategically presenting your WHY communicates directly with the **limbic brain** of your customers *(the listener)*. This has to do with their desires and needs, and the limbic brain does just that.

The **limbic brain** is closely connected to the neocortex, the part of the brain responsible for rational and analytical thinking. It is the part of the brain responsible for emotions, motivation, and behavior. It's also known as the *"emotional brain"* because it processes emotional information and plays a crucial role in decision-making.

By focusing on the "WHY", companies can create a more emotional connection with customers and inspire loyalty. It goes beyond just making profits, that's a result. They are NOT focused on the products or services themselves but on the purpose and belief system behind them.

Here are few examples successful companies' "WHY"

- Google: "To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful"
- Apple: "To empower creative exploration and self-expression."
- Canonical (Creators of Ubuntu Linux): "To enable global collaboration to produce world-changing software."
- OpenAI (ChatGPT creators): "To ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) benefits humanity."

These are the **Mission Statements** of these companies, that is what drives them to do what they do. They are usually short and memorable.

2. Resource depletion
3. Population growth
   - *cities are magnets* for people seeking better life conditions
   - Rapid population growth can strain infrastructure and services
   - leads to overcrowding, congestion and environmental degradation.
   - there are more than **22 million** refugees in the world
4. Inequality
5. Pandemics and health crises
