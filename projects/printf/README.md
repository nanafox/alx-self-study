# The _printf project

## Psedudocode Document

## Why the _printf project?

As part of the ALX Software Engineering programme, we will be required to write
our own `printf()` function. So I thought I might just take the time and try my
hands on it, even before the official task is given.

## Disclaimer

This project does not include any resources given by ALX or mimic the exact question.
At the time of developing this, the ALX SE `printf()` function hasn't started yet.
In fact, I was still in the onboarding phase when I attempted this.

## Contributions

Obviously there will be areas I will overlook and some parts I might not even think to
include in this minimalistic version of my `_printf()` function. But the good thing is
that you've seen some of them and want to help fix them. Thank you.

This is to say that your contribution is appreciated. :)
