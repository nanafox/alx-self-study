/*
So far we've covered the basics. What now?
Basically, deep dive the last section. Study up on structs, pointers, and memory management
Master input and output and data validation
Figure out how to connect to a database or file in C and make data driven applications
Study data structures and how to make them in C
    -   linked lists
    -   stack
    -   queue
    -   etc...
Then learn about more software development principles
    -   source control
    -   makefiles
    -   Deploying software to customers
    -   Testing
    -   Debugging

etc

I intend on continuing with an intermediary section that expands on a lot of this stuff.
