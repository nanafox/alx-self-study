/*
C Programming is a compiled language
    This means that all syntax has to be legal in order to create an executable file
C is one of the oldest languages still used today
    Inspired numerous other languages (C++, C#, Java, etc)
C is not object oriented
C is statically typed (all variables are given a type at compile time)
C is not forgiving - Simple mistakes are not told to you
C is dangerous but helps you learn the details and behind the scenes
C is valuable - Still in demand, foundational concepts help everyone
C is hard - Highest learning curve second to assembly
C is not TOO hard - Once you get the hang of it :)
C is low level - Console apps and working with memory directly
C is a very popluar language for system programmers or low level programmers
C has all the same programming structures used in other languages
    -   Variables and data types
    -   Operators
    -   Control flow statemtns
    -   Arrays and Strings
    -   Functions
    -   Structs
    -   And some additional goodies: Pointers and Memory Management

You won't be dissapointed going through this course.
